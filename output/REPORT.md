## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents the results of a macro regime-based factor rotation strategy.
The strategy identifies three macroeconomic regimes (Expansion, Slowdown, Recession)
and allocates across ETFs (SPY, TLT, GLD, XLK) accordingly.

---

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Regime Detection

Regimes are defined using FRED macroeconomic indicators:

| Regime | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Recession** | USREC = 1 (NBER recession indicator) |
| **Slowdown** | CPI YoY > rolling median AND ΔUNRATE > 0 |
| **Expansion** | Otherwise |

### 2.2 Portfolio Allocation

| Regime | SPY | TLT | GLD | XLK |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Expansion | 60% | 0% | 0% | 40% |
| Slowdown | 40% | 40% | 20% | 0% |
| Recession | 0% | 70% | 30% | 0% |

### 2.3 Backtest Parameters

- **Rebalancing:** Monthly
- **Transaction costs:** 5 bps per unit of turnover
- **Benchmarks:** SPY buy-and-hold, 60/40 portfolio

## 4. Regime Analysis

### 4.1 Regime Distribution

| Regime | Months | Percentage |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Expansion | 195 | 81.9% |
| Slowdown | 23 | 9.7% |
| Recession | 20 | 8.4% |

---

## 5. Limitations

1. **NBER dating lag:** Official recession dates are announced with delay
2. **Threshold sensitivity:** Rolling median period affects regime detection
3. **Look-ahead bias:** Careful to use only information available at decision time
4. **Transaction costs:** Real costs may vary with market conditions

---

## 6. Possible Improvements

1. **Hidden Markov Models:** Data-driven regime detection
2. **Additional indicators:** Yield curve slope, credit spreads, PMI
3. **Dynamic weights:** Optimize allocation within regimes
4. **Risk parity:** Volatility-adjusted position sizing

---

## 7. Conclusion

The macro regime rotation strategy demonstrates the value of adapting portfolio
allocation to macroeconomic conditions. By reducing equity exposure during
slowdowns and recessions, the strategy aims to improve risk-adjusted returns
compared to static benchmarks.
